Frontend module:
To download and run a React app from GitHub that doesn't include the `node_modules` folder (which is normal), and has a `package.json` file like the one you shared, follow these steps:

---

### âœ… Steps to Download & Set Up the Project:

1. **Download or Clone the GitHub Repo**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <repo-folder>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Since the `node_modules` folder is missing, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This will install all the dependencies listed in the `package.json`.

3. **Run the Development Server**
   After installation completes, start the React app with:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will launch the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### ðŸ›  If You Face Errors Like `react-scripts` Not Found:
Sometimes you need to manually install `react-scripts`:
```bash
npm install react-scripts --save
```

---

### ðŸ§µ Bonus: TailwindCSS
Your `devDependencies` include Tailwind CSS. If it's not already set up in the project files, you may need to configure it manually:

#### Check for:
- `tailwind.config.js`
- `postcss.config.js`
- Tailwind directives in a CSS file (e.g., `@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, `@tailwind utilities;`)

If theyâ€™re missing, I can help you set those up too.

Let me know if you run into any specific error during `npm install` or `npm start`, and Iâ€™ll help troubleshoot.
